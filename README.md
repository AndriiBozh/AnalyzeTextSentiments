I made this project to practice 'streamlit', 'matplotlib', and 'nltk'.  
There is a folder with a number of text files.  
Each file contains a random text.  
My programme reads each file, analyzes the text with nltk.sentiment module and makes two graphs with matplotlib.  
With the help of 'streamlit', data is displayed on a web page.
